faolrd
======

fully automated online language resource detection


In order to use JLanI you need wordlists in a resources folder. For example wordlist look at:
http://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/~cbiemann/software/toolbox/ASV_Toolbox_JLanIv1.0.zip

With the JLanI GUI you can create the wordlist you need.


Configuration:
 * wordlist.file: defines the location of the word list in csv format (word;frequenzy)
 * wordlist.has_header: set to true if the input file has a header line
 * wordlist.language: language of the input wordlist file
 * query.average_lentgh: average length of a query
 * query.max_length: maximum length of a query
 * query.max_queries: number of queries
 * faolrd.jlani.check_results: if true the result pages will be check by JLani
 * faolrd.use_proxies: if true the Google request will be tunneled trough proxy
 * faolrd.save_all_results: if true all results will be saved in the output file else only the confirmed results will be saved

The output file will be created in the same as the input file with an additinal _results.csv.
Each line of the output file is a result in the form:
query; result_title; result_URL; result_content; jlani_language; jlani_value

To run: mvn compile exec:java
